## About The Author:

My name is Kent Shaffer and I am a student coming to the end of UCSD's full stack web development bootcamp. Prior to starting the program I had zero code experience, so it feels I've been drinking in new information through a fire hose, but I have been loving learning, and I'm excited about all the possibilities that live within the scope of the technologies I have been learning.

If you have any questions or would like to get in contact, I can be reached at kentshaff@gmail.com
